# Maths Notes
LaTeX sources for my notes on the maths courses at Cambridge. To view the compiled PDFs, click [here](https://thirdsgames.co.uk/maths.html). Please note that these are *not* exhaustive descriptions of the courses themselves - please watch all of the lectures! This is simply a way of collating much of the courses' information in one place.

## Building
Using the LaTeX Workshop extension for Visual Studio Code is probably the easiest way to get set up building this project.

## Contributing
To contribute to the project (such as making corrections or adding explanations), fork the repository and then submit a pull request.
Any contributions must be made under the same license as the project itself.
