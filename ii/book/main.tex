\chapter{Algebraic Topology}
This course is an introduction to the basic ideas of algebraic topology.
In the first half of the course, we study an invariant of based topological spaces called the fundamental group.
This invariant associates a group to a topological space (with a basepoint).
It has the important property that a continuous map between topological spaces induces a homomorphism between their fundamental groups, and that the composition of two maps is mapped to the composition of the corresponding homomorphisms.
In slightly fancier language, the fundamental group determines a functor from the category of based topological spaces to the category of groups.
The phenomena that the fundamental group detects are essentially one-dimensional; it measures the failure of closed loops in the space to bound two-dimensional disks.

In the second half of the course, we study another functor from spaces to groups, called homology, which enables us to understand higher-dimensional `holes' in the space.
There are many different ways to define homology; we use a relatively concrete one called simplicial homology, which makes sense for a somewhat restricted class of spaces.
The notion of homology plays a central role in modern geometry and topology as well as in many branches of algebra and number theory.

Using these invariants we can distinguish various spaces from each other; for example, we can prove that \( \mathbb R^n \) is not homeomorphic to \( \mathbb R^m \) when \( n \) is not equal to \( m \).
We are also able to prove the fundamental theorem of algebra, and to show that certain maps from a space to itself (for example, any continous map from the closed \( n \)-dimensional disk to itself) must have fixed points.

\chapter{Probability and Measure}
In this course, we study measure theory and integration, and its applications to probability theory.
We begin by defining the notion of a measure, which extends the notion of the length of an interval to a much larger class of `measurable' sets.
In the context of a probability space, a probability measure is a way to associate probabilities to events that could occur.
Measures have the countable additivity property, which allows us to compute the measure of certain limits of measurable sets.
Using this property, we can analyse limiting behaviour by considering the measure of a set on which a certain event occurs.

Measure theory allows us to define the Lebesgue integral.
This integral agrees with the Riemann integral on most well-behaved functions, but it has many more convenient properties concerning limits.
For example, the dominated convergence theorem gives a sufficient condition for when the limit of the integrals of functions is the integral of the limit.
Another example is that the set of Lebegsue integrable functions forms a complete normed vector space, but this is not true of the Riemann integral.

Using the Lebesgue integral, we can define the Fourier transform of an integrable function.
This linear operator is `almost' injective: if the Fourier transform of a function is also integrable, we can recover the original function almost everywhere.
Properties of the Fourier transform are used to deduce the central limit theorem.

\chapter{Graph Theory}
A graph is a set of vertices, each pair of which may be joined with an edge.
The fact that graphs can be used to model any symmetric relation makes them widely applicable to various areas of mathematics such as knot theory.

We begin by studying various notions of connectivity of graphs, and then discuss planarity.
The famous four-colour theorem states that a planar graph can be drawn using only four colours for the vertices, such that no two joined vertices share the same colour.
While the proof of this theorem is extremely long, we prove the five-colour theorem and related results about graphs on other surfaces.

As graphs grow, we are interested in their asymptotic behaviour.
For example, how many edges must there be in a graph before we can guarantee that there is a triangle?
We study various properties of this form, and prove sufficient conditions to see certain behaviour in any given graph.
We also use probability theory to provide bounds on how likely certain events in a random graph are to occur.

\chapter{Automata and Formal Languages}
Computation, or computability, is central to modern mathematics.
However, we very rarely think about the precise definition of what it means for something to be `computable'.
There is an important difference between existence and algorithmic access to a witness.
In this course, we discuss the precise definition of computability, and use it to prove that there is no algorithm to solve certain problems.

There are many possible ways to define computation and computability, and it is a remarkable fact that most `reasonable' definitions of computable functions coincide.
This is known as the Church--Turing thesis, and it allows us to reason about computation without being tied to a specific model, such as register machines, the Turing machine, or Church's recursive functions.

A language is a set of strings called words.
Languages can be used to model countable sets, such as the set of powers of two, the set of primes, or the set of numbers which describe a register machine that determine if a given computation will halt or not.
We will explore different types of language, and use computation theory to study which properties of languages can be determined algorithmically.
We prove that there is a large class of languages for which there is an algorithm to determine if a given word lies in the language, but a much smaller class of languages for which we can determine algorithmically if they contain any words at all.

\chapter{Galois Theory}
Suppose \( K \) and \( L \) are fields, and \( K \subseteq L \).
We can view \( L \) as a vector space over \( K \), and therefore analyse things like its dimension.
We study how these extensions of fields interact, and how they can embed inside each other.

To analyse these field extensions, we will understand the Galois group associated to a particular field extension \( K \subseteq L \).
This group describes the different ways that \( L \) can embed into itself, while preserving the structure of \( K \).
This turns out to provide a measure of the complexity of \( L \) with respect to \( K \).

The central result of the course is the Galois correspondence.
If \( K \subseteq L \), there may be other fields lying between \( K \) and \( L \).
We prove that the subgroups of the Galois group correspond exactly to these intermediate fields.

We apply Galois theory to some problems that had been unsolved for many centuries or millenia.
Classic examples include doubling the cube and trisecting the angle.
We also prove that there is no formula for finding a root of the general quintic.

\chapter{Coding and Cryptography}
Coding theory allows us to mathematically reason about methods of communication.
The theory is largely broken into two parts: noiseless coding and noisy coding.

Noiseless codes describe ways to compress data into less space.
