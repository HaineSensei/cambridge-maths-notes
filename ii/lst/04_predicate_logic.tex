\subsection{?}
Recall that a \emph{group} is a set \( A \) equipped with functions \( m \colon A^2 \to A \) of arity 2, and \( i \colon A^1 \to A \) of arity 1, and a constant \( e \in A \) which can be viewed as a function \( A^0 \to A \) of arity 0, such that a set of axioms hold.
A \emph{poset} is a set \( A \) equipped with a relation \( \leq \subseteq A^2 \) of arity 2, such that a set of axioms hold.
Other algebraic structures can be described in the same way.
