\subsection{Lower bounds for Zarankiewicz numbers}
Recall the Zarankiewicz numbers \( Z(n,t) \), the maximum number of edges between a bipartite graph on \( (n, n) \) vertices, before a \( K_{t,t} \) is forced.
We have shown that \( Z(n,t) \leq 2n^{2 - \frac 1t} \), but we have found no lower bound.
\begin{theorem}
	Let \( t \geq 2 \).
	Then \( Z(n,t) \geq \frac{1}{2} n^{2 - \frac{2}{t+1}} \).
\end{theorem}
\begin{proof}
	Suppose we include each edge in the graph with probability \( p \).
	Let \( Z \) be a random variable that counts the number of \( K_{t,t} \) in the bipartite graph \( G \) on \( (n, n) \) vertices.
	Then
	\[ Z = \sum_{A \in X^{(t)}, B \in Y^{(t)}} \mathbbm 1(\text{all edges between \( A \) and \( B \) lie in \( G \)}) \]
	We find
	\[ \expect Z = \sum_{A \in X^{(t)}, B \in Y^{(t)}} \prob{\text{all edges between \( A \) and \( B \) lie in \( G \)}} = {\binom n t}^2 p^{t^2} \leq \frac{n^{2t}}{4} p^{t^2} = \frac{1}{4} (n^2 p^t)^t \]
	So if \( p = n^{-\frac{2}{t}} \), then our upper bound is at most \( \frac{1}{4} \).
	Then \( \prob{X \geq 1} \leq \frac{1}{4} \) by Markov's inequality.
	Note that \( \expect{e(G)} = pa^2 = n^{2 - \frac 2 t} \).
	So \( \prob{e(G) \leq \frac{pn^2}{2}} \leq \frac{1}{2} \).
	So with probability greater than \( \frac 14 \), we have \( e(G) > \frac{1}{2} pn^2 = \frac{1}{2} n^{2 - \frac{2}{t}} \) and \( G \) does not contain a \( K_{t,t} \).
\end{proof}
