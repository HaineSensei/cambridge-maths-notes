We will construct the projective space \( \mathbb P^n \), which will be an upgrade to \( \mathbb A^n \); it is not immediately obvious why \( \mathbb P^n \) is considered `better'.
Projective space has some interesting properties, such as:
\begin{itemize}
    \item every pair of lines in \( \mathbb P^2 \) that are distinct meet at a unique point;
    \item if \( V \) is a projective variety (defined shortly) in \( \mathbb P^2 \) defined by a degree \( d \) polynomial, if \( V \) is a manifold then \( V \) is homeomorphic in the Euclidean topology to a closed orientable topological surface of genus \( \binom{d-1}{2} \).
    \item \( \mathbb P^n \) is compact in the Euclidean topology, but \( \mathbb A^n \) is not.
\end{itemize}

\subsection{Definition}
\begin{definition}
    Let \( U \) be a finite-dimensional complex vector space.
    The \emph{projectivisation} of \( U \), written \( \mathbb P(U) \), is the set of lines in \( U \) through the origin \( \vb 0 \in U \).
    Define \( \mathbb P^n = \mathbb P(\mathbb C^{n+1}) \).
\end{definition}
We usually index the coordinates on \( \mathbb C^{n+1} \) with indices \( 0, \dots, n \).
A line in \( \mathbb C^{n+1} \) is therefore given by \( \qty{(a_0 t, \dots, a_n t) \mid t \in \mathbb C} \), and is written \( L_{(a_0, \dots, a_n)} \), where not all \( a_i \) are zero.
We write \( (a_0 : a_1 : \dots : a_n) \) for the corresponding element of \( \mathbb P^n \).
Therefore,
\[ \mathbb P^n = \faktor{\qty{(a_0, \dots, a_n) \mid a_i \in \mathbb C, \text{not all } a_i = 0}}{\text{scaling by } \mathbb C^\star} \]
For example, \( (2 : 1 : -2) = (4 : 2 : -4) \in \mathbb P^2 \).

We can decompose \( \mathbb P^1 \) as
\[ \qty{(a_0 : a_1) \mid a_0 \neq 0} \cup \qty{(a_0 : a_1) \mid a_0 = 0} = \qty{\qty(1 : z) \mid z \in \mathbb C} \cup \qty{(0 : 1)} = \mathbb A^1 \cup \text{a point at infinity} \]
More generally,
\[ \mathbb P^n = \qty{(a_0 : \dots : a_n) \mid a_0 \neq 0} \cup \qty{(0 : a_1 : \dots : a_n)} = \mathbb A^n \amalg \mathbb P^{n-1} \]
By induction, \( \mathbb P^n = \mathbb A^n \cup \mathbb A^{n-1} \cup \dots \cup \mathbb A^1 \cup \) a point, where the terms other than \( \mathbb A^n \) are considered `at infinity'.
\begin{definition}
    The \emph{Zariski} (respectively \emph{Euclidean}) topology on projective space is the quotient topology for the subspace topology for the Zariski (respectively Euclidean) topology on \( \mathbb C^{n+1} \setminus \qty{\vb 0} \), where \( \mathbb P^n = \faktor{\mathbb C^{n+1} \setminus \qty{\vb 0}}{\sim} \) and \( \mathbb C^{n+1} \setminus \qty{0} \subseteq \mathbb C^{n+1} \).
\end{definition}
There is a copy of \( \mathbb S^{2n+1} \) inside \( \mathbb C^{n+1} \setminus \qty{\vb 0} \), which therefore surjects onto \( \mathbb P^n \).
\begin{corollary}
    \( \mathbb P^n \) is compact.
\end{corollary}
\begin{proof}
    It is the continuous image of the compact set \( \mathbb S^{2n+1} \).
\end{proof}
\begin{definition}
    For \( 0 \leq j \leq n \), we define the \emph{\( j \)th coordinate hyperplane} is the set \( H_j = \qty{(\vb a_i) \mid a_j = 0} \subseteq \mathbb P^n \).
\end{definition}
We can naturally identify \( H_j \) with \( \mathbb P^{n-1} \).
\begin{definition}
    The \emph{\( j \)th standard affine patch} \( U_j \) is the complement of \( H_j \).
\end{definition}
There is a natural bijection \( U_j \to \mathbb A^n \) by mapping \( (a_0 : \dots : a_n) \) to \( \qty(\frac{a_0}{a_j}, \dots, \widehat{\frac{a_j}{a_j}}, \dots, \frac{a_n}{a_j}) \) where the hat denotes `forgetting' that element of the tuple.
The inverse function maps \( (b_1, \dots, b_n) \) to \( (b_1 : \dots : b_{j-1} : 1 : b_j : \dots : b_n) \).
We observe that \( \qty{U_j}_{j=0}^n \) is an open cover of \( \mathbb P^n \) in the Zariski topology.

\subsection{Projective varieties}
\begin{example}
    Consider the polynomial \( X_0 + 1 \in \mathbb C[X_0, X_1] \).
    Note that \( X_0 + 1 \) does not define a function on \( \mathbb P^1 \).
    For example, \( (-1 : 0) = (1 : 0) \), but \( X_0 + 1 \) vanishes on the first representative and not the second.
    The vanishing locus of \( X_0 + 1 \) on \( \mathbb P^1 \) is therefore undefined.
    Therefore, we need a slightly more subtle definition of a variety in projective space.
\end{example}
\begin{definition}
    A \emph{monomial} in \( \mathbb C[\vb X] = \mathbb C[X_0, \dots, X_n] \) is an element of the form \( X_0^{d_0} X_1^{d_1} \dots X_n^{d_n} \) where \( d_i \geq 0 \).
    A \emph{term} is a nonzero multiple of a monomial.
    The \emph{degree} of a term \( cX_0^{d_0} \dots X_n^{d_n} \) is \( \sum_{i=0}^n d_i \).
    A \emph{homogeneous polynomial} of degree \( d \) is a finite sum of terms of degree \( d \).
\end{definition}
Any polynomial can be uniquely decomposed as a sum of homogeneous polynomials of different degree; we write \( f = \sum_{i=0}^\infty f_{[i]} \) where the \( f_{[i]} \) are homogeneous of degree \( i \).
Note that this sum is always finite.
\begin{lemma}
    Let \( f \in \mathbb C[\vb X] \) be homogeneous, and let \( (a_0, \dots, a_n) \in \mathbb C^{n+1} \setminus \qty{\vb 0} \).
    Then, if \( f(\vb a) = 0 \), we have \( f(\lambda \vb a) = 0 \) for all \( \lambda \in \mathbb C^\star \).
\end{lemma}
\begin{proof}
    Trivial by checking the definitions.
\end{proof}
\begin{corollary}
    Let \( f \in \mathbb C[\vb X] \) be homogeneous.
    Then \( \mathbb V(f) = \qty{P \in \mathbb P^n \mid f(\vb a) = 0 \text{ for any (or every) representative of } P} \) is well-defined.
\end{corollary}
\begin{definition}
    An ideal \( I \trianglelefteq \mathbb C[\vb X] \) is called \emph{homogeneous} if it can be generated by homogeneous polynomials (of potentially different degrees).
\end{definition}
\begin{lemma}
    Let \( I \trianglelefteq \mathbb C[\vb X] \) be an ideal.
    Then \( I \) is homogeneous if and only if whenever \( f \in I \), all of the homogeneous parts \( f_{[r]} \) are also contained in \( I \).
\end{lemma}
\begin{proof}
    Suppose \( I \) is homogeneous.
    Then let \( g_j \) be homogeneous generators of \( I \) of degree \( d_j \).
    Writing \( f = \sum h_j g_j \) for arbitrary \( h_j \in \mathbb C[\vb X] \), we can split each \( h_j \) into its pieces \( h_{j[r]} \).
    Now, \( h_{j[r]} g_j \in I \) is homogeneous, and its degree is \( rd_j \).
    Hence, \( f_{[r]} = \sum_j h_{j[r-dj]} g_j \in I \) as required.
    The converse is trivial by decomposing the generators of the ideal.
\end{proof}
\begin{definition}
    Let \( I \trianglelefteq \mathbb C[\vb X] \) be a homogeneous ideal.
    Then, the \emph{vanishing locus} is \( \mathbb V(I) = \qty{P = (\vb a_i) \in \mathbb P^n \mid \forall f \in I,\, f((\vb a_i)) = 0} \).
    A \emph{projective variety} in \( \mathbb P^n \) is any set of this form.
\end{definition}
Note that we could have defined the vanishing locus using the quantifier `for all \emph{homogeneous} \( f \in I \)'.
\begin{example}
    Let \( U \subseteq \mathbb C^{n+1} \) be any vector subspace.
    Let the projectivisation of \( U \) is a subset of \( \mathbb P^n \), and is a projective variety.
    More concretely, \( U = \qty{\vb v \in \mathbb C^{n+1} \mid \forall j,\, \sum_{i=0}^n a_i^{(j)} v_i = 0} \) for a subset \( \vb a^{(j)} = (a_0^{(j)}, \dots, a_n^{(j)}) \), as a vector subspace is the kernel of some linear map.
    Therefore, \( \mathbb P(U) = \mathbb V(I) \) where \( I \) is the ideal generated by \( F_j = \sum_i a^{(j)}_i X_i \in \mathbb C[\vb X] \).
    More generally, a projective linear space is the projectivisation of a linear subspace.
    Hence, projective linear spaces in \( \mathbb P^n \) are in bijection with linear subspaces in \( \mathbb C^{n+1} \).
\end{example}
\( GL_{n+1}(\mathbb C) \) acts on \( \mathbb P^n \) coordinatewise.
The normal subgroup of scalar matrices \( \mathbb C^\star \subseteq GL_{n+1}(\mathbb C) \) acts trivially on \( \mathbb P^n \).
The quotient is written \( PGL_n(\mathbb C) = \faktor{GL_{n+1}(\mathbb C)}{\mathbb C^\star} \), and acts transitively on \( \mathbb P^n \).
\begin{example}
    The \emph{Segre surface} is the hypersurface \( S_{11} = \mathbb V(X_0X_3 - X_1X_2) \subseteq \mathbb P^3 \).
    Consider the map \( \sigma_{11} \colon \mathbb P^1 \times \mathbb P_1 \to \mathbb P^3 \) given by \( \sigma_{11}((a_0 : a_1), (b_0 : b_1)) = (a_0 b_0 : a_0 b_1 : a_1 b_0 : a_1 b_1) \).
    One can show that this map is well-defined, and in fact, \( \Im \sigma_{11} = S_{11} \).

    First, consider the map \( \mathbb C^2 \times \mathbb C^2 \to \mathbb C^4 \) where we identify \( \mathbb C^4 \) with the space of \( 2 \times 2 \) matrices on \( \mathbb C \), given by the outer product.
    More precisely, \( (v,w) \mapsto vw^\transpose \).
    The image of this map is precisely the set of matrices of rank at most 1.
    Hence, the image is the vanishing locus of \( X_0 X_3 - X_1 X_2 \), the determinant of such a matrix.
\end{example}

\subsection{Closed sets in projective space}
Recall that \( \mathbb P^n = U_0 \cup \dots \cup U_n \), where \( U_i = \mathbb P^n \setminus \mathbb V(X_i) \).
We therefore have the following different descriptions of a Zariski topology on \( \mathbb P^n \):
\begin{enumerate}
    \item the quotient of the subspace of the Zariski topology on \( \mathbb C^{n+1} \);
    \item define that \( V \) is Zariski-closed if and only if \( V = \mathbb V(I) \) where \( I \triangleleft \mathbb C[\vb X] \) is homogeneous;
    \item the gluing topology: define that a subset \( Z \subseteq \mathbb P^n \) is closed if \( Z \cap U_i \) is closed for all \( i \), as the \( U_i \) are isomorphic to \( \mathbb A^n \).
\end{enumerate}
These three constructions coincide.

If \( V \subseteq \mathbb P^n \) is a projective variety, consider \( U_0 \cap V \subseteq U_0 \).
If \( V = \mathbb V(I) \), then \( U_0 \cap V = \mathbb V(I_0) \) where \( I_0 = \qty{f = F(1, Y_1, \dots, Y_n) \mid F \in I \text{ homogeneous}} \subseteq \mathbb C[Y_1, \dots, Y_n] \).
Identifying \( U_0 \) with \( \mathbb A^n \) with coordinates \( Y_1, \dots, Y_n \) (so \( Y_j = \frac{X_j}{X_0} \)), \( V \cap U_0 \) is naturally an affine variety.

Conversely, let \( W \subseteq \mathbb A^n \) be an affine variety, and identify \( \mathbb A^n \) with \( U_0 \).
Then, the Zariski closure \( \overline W \) of \( W \) inside \( \mathbb P^n \) is a projective variety.
We are interested in studying the precise projective varieties obtained in this way.
\begin{definition}
    Let \( f \in \mathbb C[Y_1, \dots, Y_n] \) be an arbitrary polynomial of total degree \( d \).
    The \emph{homogenisation} of \( f \), written \( F \) or \( f^h \), is
    \[ f^h(X_0, \dots, X_n) = X_0^d f\qty(\frac{X_1}{X_0}, \dots, \frac{X_n}{X_0}) \in \mathbb C[X_0, \dots, X_n] \]
    This is homogeneous of degree \( d \).
    Similarly, if \( I \) is an ideal in \( \mathbb C[Y_1, \dots, Y_n] \), its homogenisation \( I^\star = I^h \) is the ideal generated by the homogenisation of the elements \( f \in I \); this is a homogeneous ideal in \( \mathbb C[X_0, \dots, X_n] \).
    Given an affine variety \( V \subseteq \mathbb A^n \), the \emph{projective closure} of \( V \) is \( \mathbb V(I(V)^h) \subseteq \mathbb P^n \).
\end{definition}
\begin{example}
    Let \( f(Y_1, Y_2) = 1 + Y_1^2 + Y_1 Y_2^2 \).
    Its homogenisation is \( f^h(X_0, X_1, X_2) = X_0^3 + X_0 X_1^2 + X_1 X_2^2 \).
\end{example}
\begin{remark}
    Let \( I = (f_1, \dots, f_r) \subseteq \mathbb C[Y_1, \dots, Y_n] \), and let \( J = (f_1^h, \dots, f_r^h) \).
    Typically, \( J \neq I^h \).
    If \( I \) is principal, this holds: \( I = (f) \) implies \( I^h = (f^h) \).
\end{remark}
\begin{proposition}
    Let \( V \subseteq \mathbb A^n \) be an affine variety.
    Then, the Zariski closure \( \overline V \subseteq \mathbb P^n \) given by identifying \( U_0 = \mathbb A^n \) coincides with the projective closure \( \mathbb V(I(V)^h) \subseteq \mathbb P^n \).
\end{proposition}
\begin{proof}
    Let \( I \) be an ideal in \( \mathbb C[Y_1, \dots, Y_n] \), and let \( V = \mathbb V(I) \).
    Let \( \overline V \) be the Zariski closure.
    Let \( I^h \) be the homogenisation of the ideal.
    Then \( \mathbb V(I^h) \) is Zariski closed, and contains \( V \).
    We will show that this is the smallest such set.

    Suppose \( Y \supseteq V \) is closed, so \( Y = \mathbb V(I') \) where \( I' \) is homogeneous.
    Any homogeneous element in \( I' \) can be written as \( X_0^d f^h \) for some \( f \in \mathbb C[Y_1, \dots, Y_n] \).
    Now, \( X_0^d f^h = 0 \) on \( V \subseteq \mathbb P^n \), so \( f = 0 \) on \( V \subseteq \mathbb A^n \).
    Hence \( f \in I(V) = \sqrt{I} \) by the Nullstellensatz.
    So \( f^m \in I \) for some \( m > 0 \), so \( (f^m)^h = (f^h)^m \in I^h \).
    Hence \( f^h \in \sqrt{I^h} \), so \( X_0^d f^h \in \sqrt{I^h} \).
    Therefore, \( I' \subseteq \sqrt{I^h} \).
\end{proof}
\begin{remark}
    Let \( V \subseteq \mathbb P^n \), and let \( W = V \cap U_0 \subseteq \mathbb A^n \).
    Then \( \overline W \subseteq \mathbb P^n \) is not in general equal to \( V \).
    For example, let \( V = \mathbb V(X_0) \), so \( W = \varnothing \) and \( \overline W = \varnothing \).
    This ambiguity arises due to the \( X_0^d \) term required in the above proof when dehomogenising a polynomial.
\end{remark}
This shows that the topological notion of the Zariski closure and the algebraic notion of the projective closure agree.
\begin{example}
    Let \( V \subseteq \mathbb P^2 \) be given by \( \mathbb V(X_0 X_1 - X_2^2) \).
    We obtain \( V_0 \subseteq U_0 \) given by setting \( X_0 = 1 \), \( V_1 \subseteq U_1 \) given by setting \( X_1 = 1 \), and \( V_2 \subseteq U_2 \) given by setting \( X_2 = 1 \).
    We find \( V_0 = \mathbb V(Y_1 - Y_2^2) \) which is a parabola, and \( V_1 \) is similar.
    \( V_2 = \mathbb V(X_0 X_1 - 1) \), which is a rectangular hyperbola.
\end{example}
\begin{theorem}
    Let \( Q \subseteq \mathbb P^n \) be given by \( \mathbb V(f) \) where \( f \) is a homogeneous quadratic polynomial.
    Then, after a change of coordinates \( A \in PGL_{n+1}(\mathbb C) \), \( Q \) has the form \( \mathbb V(X_0^2 + \dots + X_r^2) \) where \( r \) is the rank of the quadratic form \( f \).
\end{theorem}
\begin{proof}
    Use the results from IB Linear Algebra.
\end{proof}
\begin{theorem}[projective Nullstellensatz]
    If \( \mathbb V(I) = \varnothing \subseteq \mathbb P^n \) where \( I \) is a homogeneous ideal, then \( I \supseteq (X_0^m, \dots, X_n^m) \) for some \( m \in \mathbb N \).
    Further, if \( V = \mathbb V(I) \neq \varnothing \), then \( I^h(V) = \sqrt{I} \), where \( I^h(V) \) is the ideal generated by homogeneous polynomials vanishing on \( V \).
\end{theorem}
\begin{proof}
    We reduce to the affine case.
    Let \( I \) be a homogeneous ideal, and let \( V^a = \mathbb V(I) \subseteq \mathbb A^{n+1} \).
    Note that \( \vb 0 \in V^a \), assuming \( V \neq \varnothing \).
    Then there is a continuous map \( V^a \setminus \qty{0} \to V \) obtained by the restriction of \( \mathbb A^{n+1} \setminus \qty{\vb 0} \to \mathbb P^n \).
    Moreover, this map is surjective, so is a quotient map.
    Note that \( V \) is empty if and only if \( V^a = \qty{\vb 0} \).
    So the result holds by the affine Nullstellensatz.
    The second part is similar.
\end{proof}
Let \( V \) be a projective variety in \( \mathbb P^n \).
If \( W \subseteq V \) is a variety closed in \( V \), we say \( W \) is a \emph{closed subvariety} of \( V \).
The complement \( V \setminus W \) is an \emph{open subvariety}.
The closed (respectively open) subvarieties of \( V \) satisfy the axioms of the closed (open) sets of a topology.
We say \( V \) is irreducible if \( V \) cannot be written as \( V_1 \cup V_2 \) for proper closed subvarieties \( V_1, V_2 \).
\begin{proposition}
    \begin{enumerate}
        \item Every projective variety is a finite union of irreducible varieties.
        \item \( V \) is irreducible if and only if \( I^h(V) \) is prime.
    \end{enumerate}
\end{proposition}
\begin{proof}
    Part (i) is identical to the affine case.
    For part (ii), first observe that if \( I \) is a homogeneous ideal which is not prime, we can find homogeneous \( F, G \not\in I \) such that \( FG \in I \), as \( I \) is generated by homogeneous elements.
    Then the proof for the affine case works as before.
\end{proof}
Let \( S \subseteq V \) be a subset.
\( S \) is Zariski dense in \( V \) if and only if every homogeneous polynomial that vanishes on \( S \) vanishes on \( V \).
\begin{proposition}
    Let \( V \subseteq \mathbb P^n \) be an irreducible projective variety.
    Let \( W \subsetneq V \) be a proper closed subvariety.
    Then, \( V \setminus W \) is dense in \( V \).
\end{proposition}
Intuitively, \( W \) is lower-dimensional than \( V \), and \( V \) with a lower-dimensional set removed is dense.
\begin{proof}
    Let \( f \in \mathbb C[\vb X] \) be a homogeneous polynomial that vanishes on \( V \setminus W \).
    As \( W \neq V \), there exists a polynomial \( g \in I^h(W) \setminus I^h(V) \) by the projective Nullstellensatz.
    Then, \( fg \) vanishes on all of \( V \).
    But \( I^h(V) \) is prime as \( V \) is irreducible, so \( f \in I^h(V) \).
\end{proof}

\subsection{Function theory on projective varieties}
Homogeneous polynomials have well-defined zero sets in \( \mathbb P^n \), but not a well-defined value.
Therefore, we cannot define a coordinate ring \( \mathbb C[V] \) in an analogous way.
However, a ratio of homogeneous polynomials of the same degree does have a well-defined value on \( \mathbb P^n \) away from the vanishing locus of the denominator.
\begin{definition}
    Let \( V \subseteq \mathbb P^n \) be an irreducible projective variety.
    The \emph{function field} or \emph{field of rational functions} is
    \[ \mathbb C(V) = \faktor{\qty{\frac{F}{G} \mid F, G \in \mathbb C[\vb X] \text{ homogeneous and have the same degree, } G \not\in I^h(V)}}{\sim} \]
    where \( \frac{F_1}{G_1} \sim \frac{F_2}{G_2} \) if \( F_1 G_2 - F_2 G_1 \in I^h(V) \).
\end{definition}
\begin{lemma}
    The relation \( \sim \) is an equivalence relation.
\end{lemma}
\begin{proof}
    Reflexivity and symmetry are clear.
    Now suppose that \( \frac{F_1}{G_1} \sim \frac{F_2}{G_2} \sim \frac{F_3}{G_3} \), so \( F_2 G_1 - F_1 G_2 \in I^h(V) \) and \( F_3 G_2 - F_2 G_3 \in I^h(V) \).
    Consider \( F_1 G_3 - F_3 G_1 \).
    Multiplying by \( G_2 \), \( F_1 G_2 G_3 - F_3 G_1 G_2 \).
    Since \( G_2 \not\in I^h(V) \), primality of \( I^h(V) \) implies that it suffices to show \( F_1 G_2 G_3 - F_3 G_1 G_2 \in I^h(V) \).
    In the ring \( \faktor{\mathbb C[\vb X]}{I^h(V)} \), we have relations \( F_1 G_2 = F_2 G_1 \) and \( F_3 G_2 = F_2 G_3 \).
    Hence \( F_1 G_2 G_3 - F_3 G_1 G_2 = 0 \) in \( \faktor{\mathbb C[\vb X]}{I^h(V)} \).
\end{proof}
Note that \( \mathbb C(V) \) is a field.
\begin{proposition}
    The field \( \mathbb C(V) \) is a finitely generated field extension of \( \mathbb C \).
\end{proposition}
Note that \( \mathbb C(t) \) is finitely generated as a field, but not finitely generated as a \( \mathbb C \)-module or a \( \mathbb C \)-algebra.
\begin{proof}
    Suppose \( V \neq \varnothing \).
    Then, there is some coordinate function \( X_i \) that is nonzero on \( V \); without loss of generality let \( i = 0 \).
    We claim that \( \frac{X_1}{X_0}, \dots, \frac{X_n}{X_0} \) generate \( \mathbb C(V) \) over \( \mathbb C \).
    Explicitly, if \( \frac{F}{G} \) is a degree 0 ratio, it can be written in terms of the \( \frac{X_j}{X_0} \) and the field operations.
    It suffices to show the result holds when \( \frac{F}{G} \) is of the form \( \frac{M}{G} \) where \( M \) is a monomial.
    Then, it suffices to show the result for \( \frac{G}{M} \) where \( M \) is a monomial by taking reciprocals.
    Hence, it suffices to show the result for \( \frac{M}{M'} \) where \( M, M' \) are monomials, and this is trivial.
\end{proof}
\begin{corollary}
    Let \( V \subseteq \mathbb P^n \) be an irreducible projective variety, not contained in the hyperplane \( \qty{X_0 = 0} \).
    Let \( V_0 = V \cap U_0 \), where \( U_0 \simeq \mathbb A^n \) is the first affine patch.
    Then, \( \mathbb C(V_0) = \mathbb C(V) \), where \( \mathbb C(V_0) = FF(\mathbb C[V_0]) \).
\end{corollary}
\begin{proof}
    \( V_0 \) has coordinate ring
    \[ \faktor{\mathbb C\qty[\frac{X_1}{X_0}, \dots, \frac{X_n}{X_0}]}{I(V_0)} \]
    Hence, \( \mathbb C(V_0) = FF(\mathbb C[V_0]) \) is generated by the \( \frac{X_j}{X_0} \).
\end{proof}
