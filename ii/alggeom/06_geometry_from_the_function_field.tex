If \( K \subseteq L \) are fields and \( \alpha \in L \), we say that \( \alpha \) is \emph{transcendental} over \( K \) if it is not a solution to a nontrivial polynomial \( f \in K[t] \).
More generally, if \( S \subseteq L \) is any set of elements, we say they are \emph{algebraically independent} if they do not satisfy a nontrivial polynomial relation over \( K \).
A field extension \( K / \mathbb C \) is a \emph{pure transcendental extension} if \( K \) is generated by transcendental algebraically independent elements \( x_1, \dots, x_n \in K \).
