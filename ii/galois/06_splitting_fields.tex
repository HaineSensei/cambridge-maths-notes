\subsection{Definition}
Suppose \( K \) is a field and \( f \in K[T] \).
We wish to find an extension \( L / K \) of degree as small as possible such that \( f \) is expressible as a product of linear factors in \( L[T] \).
\begin{example}
	Let \( K = \mathbb Q \).
	Then by the fundamental theorem of algebra, a monic polynomial \( f \in \mathbb Q[T] \) is expressible as a product of \( n \) linear factors \( (T - x_i) \) in \( \mathbb C[T] \).
	One example of such a field extension is \( L = \mathbb Q(x_1, \dots, x_n) \), which is a finite extension of \( \mathbb Q \).
\end{example}
We will later give another proof of the fundamental theorem of algebra using techniques from Galois theory.
\begin{example}
	Let \( K = \mathbb F_p \), and \( f \) is irreducible and has degree \( d > 1 \).
	Since there is no ambient field structure, explicitly finding \( L \) is more challenging.
	We will first find an extension in which \( f \) has at least one root, and then use induction.
\end{example}
Suppose \( f \in K[T] \) is a (monic) irreducible polynomial.
Then consider \( L_f = \faktor{K[T]}{(f)} \).
Since \( f \) is irreducible, \( (f) \) is maximal, hence \( L_f \) is a field.
Then, by construction, if \( x = T + (f) \), \( f(x) = 0 \) in \( L_f \).
