\subsection{Cubics}
Let \( f \in K[T] \) be a monic separable cubic.
Then \( G = \Gal(f/K) \leq S_3 \) acting on the roots \( x_1, x_2, x_3 \) in a splitting field \( L \) of \( K \).
If \( f \) is reducible, \( f \) is either a product of three linear factors, in which case \( G \) is trivial, or \( f \) is a linear factor multiplied by a quadratic, in which case \( G \) is isomorphic to \( S_2 \).

Now suppose \( f \) is irreducible.
We will assume that \( \fchar K \neq 2, 3 \).
We have \( G = S_3 \) or \( G = A_3 \).
We know that \( G = A_3 \) if and only if the discriminant \( \mathrm{Disc}(f) \) is a square in \( K^\times \).
In general, the Galois correspondence yields
\begin{center}
    \begin{tikzcd}
        {L = K(x_1, x_2, x_3)} && {\qty{1}} \\
        {K(\Delta)=L^{G \cap A_3}} && {G \cap A_3} \\
        K && G
        \arrow["{3 \text{ if } f \text{ irreducible, else } 1}", from=1-1, to=2-1]
        \arrow["{2 \text{ or } 1}", from=2-1, to=3-1]
        \arrow[from=3-3, to=2-3]
        \arrow[from=2-3, to=1-3]
    \end{tikzcd}
\end{center}
Then \( K_1 = K(\sqrt{\mathrm{Disc}(f)}) \), and \( K_1 = L \) if \( f \) is reducible.

In the irreducible case, \( L / K_1 \) is Galois with \( \Gal(L/K_1) \simeq \faktor{\mathbb Z}{3\mathbb Z} \).
Recall that if \( \omega \in K_1 \) is a primitive third root of unity, then \( L = K_1(y) \) where \( y^3 \in K_1 \), by Kummer theory.

If not, let \( L(\omega) \) be the splitting field of \( f \cdot (T^3 - 1) \) over \( K \).
Then \( L(\omega) / K_1(\omega) \) is Galois with Galois group \( \faktor{\mathbb Z}{3\mathbb Z} \) as before.
So \( L(\omega) = K_1(\omega, y) \) where \( y^3 \in K_1(\omega) \).

Therefore, in every case, \( x_i \) lie in the field obtained by adjoining successive square roots and cube roots to \( K \), since \( \omega = \frac{-1 + \sqrt{-3}}{2} \).
This is a theoretical description of Cardano's solution to the cubic.
