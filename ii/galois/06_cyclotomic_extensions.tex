\subsection{?}
\begin{lemma}
	Let \( C \) be a cyclic group of order \( n > 1 \).
	Let \( a \in \mathbb Z \) be coprime to \( n \).
	Then the map \( [a] \colon C \to C \) given by \( [a](g) = g^a \) is an automorphism of \( C \), and the map \( \qty(\faktor{\mathbb Z}{n\mathbb Z})^\times \to \Aut(C) \) defined by \( a \mapsto [a] \) is an isomorphism.
\end{lemma}
\begin{proof}
	\( [a] \) is clearly a homomorphism, and since \( a \) is coprime to \( n \), it is an automorphism since there exists \( b \) such that \( ab \) is congruent to 1 modulo \( n \).
	Hence, there is an injection \( \qty(\faktor{\mathbb Z}{n\mathbb Z})^\times \to \Aut(C) \) given by \( a \mapsto [a] \), and it is a homomorphism.
	If \( \varphi \in \Aut(C) \) and \( g \) is a generator for \( C \), \( \varphi(g) = g^a \) for some \( a \in \qty(\faktor{\mathbb Z}{n\mathbb Z})^\times \).
	So \( \varphi = [a] \), and in particular, the map is an isomorphism.
\end{proof}
