\subsection{Definition}
\begin{definition}
	An extension \( L / K \) is a \emph{normal extension} if it is algebraic and for all \( x \in L \), the minimal polynomial splits in \( L \).
\end{definition}
\begin{remark}
	This condition is equivalent to the statement that for every \( x \in L \), \( L \) contains a splitting field for \( x \).
	In other words, if an irreducible polynomial \( f \in K[T] \) has a single root in \( L \), it splits and has all roots in \( L \).
\end{remark}
\begin{theorem}
	Let \( L / K \) be a finite extension.
	Then \( L \) is normal over \( K \) if and only if \( L \) is a splitting field for some (not necessarily irreducible) polynomial \( f \in K[T] \).
\end{theorem}
\begin{proof}
	Suppose \( L \) is normal.
	Then \( L = K(x_1, \dots, x_n) \) since \( L \) is algebraic.
	Then the minimal polynomial \( m_{x_i,K} \) of each \( x_i \) over \( K \) splits in \( L \).
	\( L \) is generated by the roots of \( \prod_i m_{x_i,K} \), so \( L \) is a splitting field for \( f \).

	For the converse, suppose \( L \) is a splitting field for \( f \in K[T] \).
	Let \( x \in L \), and let \( g = m_{x,K} \) be its minimal polynomial.
	We want to show that \( g \) splits in \( L \).
	Let \( M \) be a splitting field for \( g \) over \( L \), and let \( y \in M \) be a root of \( g \).
	We want to show \( y \in L \).
	
	Since \( L \) is a splitting field for \( f \) over \( K \), \( L \) is a splitting field for \( f \) over \( K(x) \), and \( L(y) \) is a splitting field for \( f \) over \( K(y) \).
	Now, there exists a \( K \)-isomorphism between \( K(x) \) and \( K(y) \), because \( x, y \) are roots of the same irreducible polynomial \( g \).
	By the uniqueness of splitting fields, \( [L:K(x)] = [L(y):K(y)] \).
	Multiplying by \( [K(x):K] \), we find \( [L:K] = [L(y):K] \) because \( [K(y):K] = [K(x):K] \) as they are roots of the same irreducible polynomial.
	Hence \( [L(y):L] = 1 \), so \( y \in L \) as required.
\end{proof}
