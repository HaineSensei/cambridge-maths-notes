We present three important decision problems.
\begin{enumerate}
	\item Consider the \emph{word problem}.
		The input to this problem is a grammar and a word; the question is to determine whether the word lies in the language generated by the grammar.
	\item The \emph{emptiness problem} considers a grammar \( G \).
		The question is whether \( \mathcal L(G) = \varnothing \).
	\item The \emph{equivalence problem} asks whether two grammars \( G, G' \) are equivalent.
\end{enumerate}
\begin{definition}
	We call a problem \emph{solvable} if there is an algorithm that gives the correct answer.
	Otherwise, we call such a problem \emph{unsolvable}.
\end{definition}
Posed for all grammars, all three problems above are unsolvable.
However, when restricted to certain classes of the Chomsky hierarchy, the problems are more approachable.
