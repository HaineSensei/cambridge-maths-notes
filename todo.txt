Plan to reorganise the content such that the course content is sequential but grouped into files by topic rather than by lecture.

Separate the book into volumes for each year (IA/IB/II); the current full book is too large to be practical.

Canonicalise use of `non zero', `nonzero' and `non-zero'.

Convert util.tex into a *.sty.

Remove subsection titles from examples.
