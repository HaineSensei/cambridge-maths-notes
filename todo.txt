Canonicalise use of
- D\eval{f} and \eval{Df};
- ^\star and ^\times for multiplicative groups;

Remove subsection titles from examples.

Remove all references to individual lectures.

Use texorpdfstring for section headers.

Copy out the distribution tables for statistics.

Convert \mid to \midd where appropriate.

Deal with "\dots \).".

Line breaks before large "\align"s to fix page break issues.

Carefully revisit each section and subsection name and scope.
Add "the" before certain subsection names.
Additionally delete extraneous (sub)sections, especially in IA/IB: aim for 5-10 sections per course and 3-8 subsections per section.

Potentially automate conversion of large inline math blocks to display blocks.

Create a version for print.
- Separate into appropriate volumes.
- Remove colour. Search for words referencing colour in diagrams (e.g. "red") and replace text with suitable alternatives.
- Spellcheck (unless it gets too cumbersome to program one to allow mathematical jargon).
- Edit the introduction text.
- Add course introductions.
- Based on font choices, edit spacing inside \faktor.
- Fix appearance of \not, such as \not\to (this specific instance has been corrected).
