Let \( (X, \mathcal O_X) \) be a scheme.
The stalks \( \mathcal O_{X,\mathfrak p} \) are local rings: they have a unique maximal ideal, which is the set of all non-unit elements.
Given \( f \in \mathcal O_X(U) \), we can meaningfully ask whether \( f \) vanishes at \( \mathfrak p \); that is, if the image of \( f \) in \( \mathcal O_{X, \mathfrak p} \) is contained in the maximal ideal.
\begin{definition}
    A morphism of ringed spaces \( f : (X, \mathcal O_X) \to (Y, \mathcal O_Y) \) consists of a continuous function \( f : X \to Y \) and a morphism \( f^\sharp : \mathcal O_Y \to f_\star \mathcal O_X \) between sheaves of rings on \( Y \).
\end{definition}
\( f^\sharp \) represents function composition with \( f^{-1} \), although the ring \( \mathcal O_X \) may not be a ring of functions.
