\begin{proposition}[Zariski's lemma]
    Let \( k \subseteq L \) be fields where \( L \) is finitely generated as a \( k \)-algebra.
    Then \( \dim_k L \) is finite.
\end{proposition}
\begin{proof}
    By Noether normalisation, we have
    \[ k \subseteq k[x_1, \dots, x_n] \subseteq L \]
    where \( x_1, \dots, x_n \) are algebraically independent over \( k \), and \( L \) is finite over \( k[x_1, \dots, x_n] \).
    As this is an integral extension of integral domains and \( L \) is a field, \( k[x_1, \dots, x_n] \) must be a field.
    But as \( k[x_1, \dots, x_n] \) is a polynomial algebra over \( k \), the \( x_i \) cannot be invertible.
    Hence \( n = 0 \), so \( k \subseteq L \) is finite as required.
\end{proof}
