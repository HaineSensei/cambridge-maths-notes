\subsection{Null recurrent limiting behaviour}
\begin{theorem}
	Let \( P \) be irreducible, aperiodic, and null recurrent.
	Then, for all \( x, y \),
	\[
		\lim_{n \to \infty} P^n(x,y) = 0
	\]
\end{theorem}
\begin{proof}
	Let \( \widetilde P((x,y),(x',y')) = P(x,x')P(y,y') \) as before.
	We have shown previously that \( \widetilde P \) is also irreducible.
	Suppose first that \( \widetilde P \) is transient.
	Then,
	\[
		\sum_n \widetilde P^n((x,y),(x,y)) < \infty
	\]
	This sum is equal to
	\[
		\sum_n (P^n(x,y))^2 < \infty
	\]
	Hence,
	\[
		P^n(x,y) \to 0
	\]
	Now, conversely suppose that \( \widetilde P \) is recurrent.
	Let \( y \in I \).
	Define as before
	\[
		\nu_y(x) = \esub{y}{\sum_{i=0}^{T_y - 1} 1(X_i = x)}
	\]
	This measure is invariant for \( P \) since \( P \) is recurrent.
	Since \( P \) is null recurrent in particular, \( \esub{y}{T_y} = \infty \).
	Hence,
	\[
		\nu_y(I) = \sum_{x \in I} \nu_y(x) = \esub{y}{\sum_{i=0}^{T_y - 1} 1} = \esub{y}{T_y} = \infty
	\]
	Because \( \nu_y(I) \) is infinite, for all \( M > 0 \) there exists a finite set \( A \subset I \) with \( \nu_y(A) > M \).
	Now, we define a probability measure
	\[
		\mu(z) = \frac{\nu_y(z)}{\nu_y(A)} 1(z \in A)
	\]
	Now, for all \( z \in I \),
	\[
		\mu P^n(z) = \sum_x \mu(x) P^n(x,z) = \sum_x \frac{\nu_y(x)}{\nu_y(A)} 1(z \in A) P^n(x,z) \leq \frac{1}{\nu_y(A)} \sum_x \nu_y(x) P^n(x,z)
	\]
	Since \( \nu_y \) is invariant,
	\[
		\mu P^n(z) \leq \frac{1}{\nu_y(A)} \nu_y(z) = \frac{\nu_y(z)}{\nu_y(A)}
	\]
	Let \( (X, Y) \) be a Markov chain with matrix \( \widetilde P \), started according to \( \mu \times \delta_x \), so \( \prob{X_0 = z, Y_0 = w} = \mu(z) \delta_x(w) \).
	Now, let
	\[
		T = \inf\qty{n \geq 1 \colon (X_n, Y_n) = (x,x)}
	\]
	Since \( \widetilde P \) is recurrent, \( T \) is finite with probability 1.
	Let
	\[
		Z_n = \begin{cases}
			X_n & n < T    \\
			Y_n & n \geq T
		\end{cases}
	\]
	We have already proven that \( Z \) is a Markov chain with transition matrix \( P \), started according to \( \mu \); it has the same distribution as \( X \).
	Hence,
	\[
		\prob{Z_n = y} = \mu P^n(y) \leq \frac{\nu_y(y)}{\nu_y(A)} = \frac{1}{\nu_y(A)}
	\]
	Note,
	\[
		\psub{x}{Y_n = y} \leq \psub{x}{Y_n = y, n \geq T} + \psub{x}{T > n} = \psub{x}{Z_n = y} + \psub{x}{T > n}
	\]
	Hence,
	\[
		\limsup_{n \to \infty} \psub{x}{Y_n = y} \leq \frac{1}{M} + 0 = \frac{1}{M}
	\]
	Since this is true for all \( M \), \( P^n(x,y) \to 0 \) as \( n \to \infty \).
\end{proof}
