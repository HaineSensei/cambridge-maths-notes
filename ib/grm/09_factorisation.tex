In this section, let \( R \) be an integral domain.

\subsection{Prime and irreducible elements}
Recall that an element \( a \in R \) is a unit if it has a multiplicative inverse in \( R \).
Equivalently, an element \( a \) is a unit if and only if \( (a) = R \).
Indeed, if \( (a) = R \), then \( 1 \in (a) \) hence there exists a multiple of \( a \) equal to 1.
We denote the set of units in \( R \) by \( R^\times \).
\begin{definition}
    An element \( a \in R \) \textit{divides} \( b \in R \), written \( a \mid b \), if there exists \( c \in R \) such that \( b = ac \).
    Equivalently, \( (b) \subseteq (a) \).

    Two elements \( a, b \in R \) are \textit{associates} if \( a = bc \) where \( c \) is a unit.
    Informally, the two elements differ by multiplication by a unit.
    Equivalently, \( (a) = (b) \).
\end{definition}
\begin{definition}
    An element \( r \in R \) is \textit{irreducible} if \( r \) is not zero or a unit, and \( r = ab \) implies \( a = 1 \) or \( b = 1 \).
    An element \( r \in R \) is \textit{prime} if \( r \) is not zero or a unit, and \( r \mid ab \) implies \( r \mid a \) or \( r \mid b \).
\end{definition}
\begin{remark}
    These properties depend on the ambient ring \( R \); for instance, 2 is prime and irreducible in \( \mathbb Z \), but neither prime nor irreducible in \( \mathbb Q \).
    The polynomial \( 2X \) is irreducible in \( \mathbb Q[X] \), but not in \( \mathbb Z[X] \).
\end{remark}
\begin{lemma}
    \( (r) \triangleleft R \) is a prime ideal if and only if \( r = 0 \) or \( r \) is prime.
\end{lemma}
\begin{proof}
    Suppose \( (r) \) is a prime ideal with \( r \neq 0 \).
    Since prime ideals are proper, \( r \) cannot be a unit.
    Suppose \( r \mid ab \), or equivalently, \( ab \in (r) \).
    By the definition of a prime ideal, \( a \in (r) \) or \( b \in (r) \).
    Hence, \( r \mid a \) or \( r \mid b \).
    By definition of a prime element, \( r \) is prime.

    Conversely, first note that the zero ideal \( (0) = \qty{0} \) is a prime ideal, since \( R \) is an integral domain.
    Suppose \( r \) is prime.
    We know \( (r) \neq R \) since \( r \) is not a unit.
    If \( ab \in (r) \), then \( r \mid ab \), so \( r \mid a \) or \( r \mid b \), giving \( a \in (r) \) or \( b \in (r) \) as required for \( (r) \) to be a prime ideal.
\end{proof}
\begin{lemma}
    Prime elements are irreducible.
\end{lemma}
\begin{proof}
    Let \( r \) be prime.
    Then \( r \) is nonzero and not a unit.
    Suppose \( r = ab \).
    Then, in particular, \( r \mid ab \), so \( r \mid a \) or \( r \mid b \) by primality.
    Let \( r \mid a \) without loss of generality.
    Hence \( a = rc \) for some element \( c \in R \).
    Then, \( r = ab = rcb \), so \( r(1-cb) = 0 \).
    Since \( R \) is an integral domain, and \( r \neq 0 \), we have \( cb = 1 \), so \( b \) is a unit.
\end{proof}
\begin{example}
    The converse does not hold in general.
    Let
    \[ R = \mathbb Z[\sqrt{-5}] = \qty{a+b\sqrt{-5} \colon a,b \in \mathbb Z} \leq \mathbb C;\quad R \cong \faktor{\mathbb Z[X]}{(X^2 + 5)} \]
    Since \( R \) is a subring of the field \( \mathbb C \), it is an integral domain.
    We can define the \textit{norm} \( N \colon R \to \mathbb Z \) by \( N(a+b\sqrt{-5}) = a^2 + 5b^2 \geq 0 \).
    Note that this norm is multiplicative: \( N(z_1 z_2) = N(z_1) N(z_2) \).

    We claim that the units are exactly \( \pm 1 \).
    Indeed, if \( r \in R^\times \), then \( rs = 1 \) for some element \( s \in R \).
    Then, \( N(r) N(s) = N(1) = 1 \), so \( N(r) = N(s) = 1 \).
    But the only elements \( r \in R \) with \( N(r) = 1 \) are \( r = \pm 1 \).

    We will now show that the element \( 2 \in R \) is irreducible.
    Suppose \( 2 = rs \) for \( r,s \in R \).
    By the multiplicative property of \( N \), \( N(2) = 4 = N(r) N(s) \) can only be satisfied by \( N(r), N(s) \in \qty{1,2,4} \).
    Since \( a^2 + 5b^2 = 2 \) has no integer solutions, \( R \) has no elements of norm 2.
    Hence, either \( r \) or \( s \) has unit norm and is thus a unit by the above discussion.
    We can show similarly that \( 3, 1 + \sqrt{-5}, 1 - \sqrt{-5} \) are irreducible, as there exist no elements of norm 3.

    We can now compute directly that \( (1 + \sqrt{-5})(1-\sqrt{-5}) = 6 = 2 \cdot 3 \), hence \( 2 \mid (1 + \sqrt{-5})(1-\sqrt{-5}) \).
    But \( 2 \nmid (1 + \sqrt{-5}) \) and \( 2 \nmid (1 - \sqrt{-5}) \), which can be checked by taking norms.
    Hence, 2 is irreducible but not a prime.

    In order to construct this example, we have exhibited two factorisations of 6 into irreducibles: \( (1 + \sqrt{-5})(1-\sqrt{-5}) = 6 = 2 \cdot 3 \).
    Since \( R^\times = \pm 1 \), these irreducibles in the factorisations are not associates.
\end{example}

\subsection{Principal ideal domains}
\begin{definition}
    An integral domain \( R \) is a \textit{principal ideal domain} if all ideals are principal ideals.
    In other words, for all ideals \( I \), there exists an element \( r \) such that \( I = (r) \).
\end{definition}
\begin{example}
    \( \mathbb Z \) is a principal ideal domain.
\end{example}
\begin{proposition}
    In a principal ideal domain, all irreducible elements are prime.
\end{proposition}
\begin{proof}
    Let \( r \in R \) be irreducible, and suppose \( r \mid ab \).
    If \( r \mid a \), the proof is complete, so suppose \( r \nmid a \).
    Since \( R \) is a principal ideal domain, the ideal \( (a,r) \) is generated by a single element \( d \in R \).
    In particular, since \( r \in (d) \), we have \( d \mid r \) so \( r = cd \) for some \( c \in R \).

    Since \( r \) is irreducible, either \( c \) or \( d \) is a unit.
    If \( c \) is a unit, \( (a,r) = (r) \), so in particular \( r \mid a \), which contradicts the assumption that \( r \nmid a \), so \( c \) cannot be a unit.
    Thus, \( d \) is a unit.
    In this case, \( (a,r) = R \).
    By definition of \( (a,r) \), there exist \( s, t \in R \) such that \( 1 = sa + tr \).
    Then, \( b = sab + trb \).
    We have \( r \mid sab \) since \( r \mid ab \), and we know \( r \mid trb \).
    Hence \( r \mid b \) as required.
\end{proof}
\begin{lemma}
	Let \( R \) be a principal ideal domain.
	Then an element \( r \) is irreducible if and only if \( (r) \) is maximal.
\end{lemma}
\begin{proof}
	Suppose \( r \) is irreducible.
	Since \( r \) is not a unit, \( (r) \neq R \).
	Suppose \( (r) \subseteq J \subseteq R \) where \( J \) is an ideal in \( R \).
	Since \( R \) is a principal ideal domain, \( J = (a) \) for some \( a \in R \).
	In particular, \( r = ab \) for some \( b \in R \), since \( (r) \subseteq J \).
	Since \( r \) is irreducible, either \( a \) or \( b \) is a unit.
	But if \( a \) is a unit, we have \( J = R \).
	If \( b \) is a unit, then \( a \) and \( r \) are associates so they generate the same ideal.
	Hence, \( (r) \) is maximal.
	
	Conversely, suppose \( (r) \) is maximal.
	Note that \( r \) is not a unit, since \( (r) \neq R \).
	Suppose \( r = ab \).
	Then \( (r) \subseteq (a) \subseteq R \).
	But since \( (r) \) is maximal, either \( (a) = (r) \) or \( (a) = R \).
	If \( (a) = (r) \), then \( b \) is a unit.
	If \( (a) = R \), then \( a \) is a unit.
	Hence \( r \) is irreducible.
	Note that this direction of the proof did not require that \( R \) was a principal ideal domain, however \( R \) must still be an integral domain.
\end{proof}
\begin{remark}
	Let \( R \) be a principal integral domain, and \( 0 \neq r \in R \).
	Then, \( (r) \) is maximal if and only if \( r \) is irreducible, which is true if and only if \( r \) is prime, which is equivalent to the fact that \( (r) \) is prime.
	Hence, the maximal ideals are the nonzero prime ideals.
\end{remark}
\begin{definition}
	An integral domain is a \textit{Euclidean domain} if there exists a function \( \varphi \colon R \setminus \qty{0} \to \mathbb Z_{\geq 0} \) such that, for all \( a, b \in R \).
	\begin{enumerate}[(i)]
		\item if \( a \mid b \) then \( \varphi(a) \leq \varphi(b) \);
		\item if \( b \neq 0 \) then \( \exists q, r \in R \) such that \( a = bq + r \) and either \( r = 0 \) or \( \varphi(r) < \varphi(b) \).
	\end{enumerate}
	Such a \( \varphi \) is called a \textit{Euclidean function}.
\end{definition}
\begin{example}
	\( \mathbb Z \) is a Euclidean domain, where the Euclidean function \( \varphi \) is the absolute value function.
\end{example}
\begin{proposition}
	Euclidean domains are principal ideal domains.
\end{proposition}
\begin{proof}
	Let \( R \) have Euclidean function \( \varphi \).
	Let \( I \triangleleft R \) be a nonzero ideal.
	Let \( b \in I \setminus \qty{0} \) that minimises \( \varphi(b) \).
	Then \( (b) \subseteq I \).
	For any element \( a \in I \), we can use the Euclidean algorithm to show \( a = bq + r \) where \( r = 0 \) or \( \varphi(r) < \varphi(b) \).
	But since \( r = a - bq \in I \), \( \varphi(r) \) cannot be lower than the minimal element \( \varphi(b) \).
	Thus \( r = 0 \), so \( a = bq \).
	Hence, \( I = (b) \), so all ideals are principal.
\end{proof}
\begin{remark}
	In the above proof, only the second property of the Euclidean function was used.
	The first property is included in the definition since it will allow us to easily describe the units in the ring.
	\[ R^\times = \qty{u \in R \colon u \neq 0, \varphi(u) = \varphi(1)} \]
	It can be shown that, if there exists a function \( \varphi \) satisfying (ii), there exists a (possibly not unique) function \( \varphi' \) satisfying (i) and (ii).
\end{remark}
\begin{example}
	Let \( F \) be a field.
	Then \( F[X] \) is a Euclidean domain with Euclidean function \( \varphi(f) = \mathrm{deg}(f) \).
	We have already proven the requisite properties of Euclidean functions.

	The ring \( R = \mathbb Z[i] \) is a Euclidean domain with \( \varphi(u+iv) = N(u+iv) = u^2+v^2 \).
	Since the norm is multiplicative, \( N(zw) = N(z)N(w) \) which immediately gives property (i) in the definition.
	Consider \( z, w \in \mathbb Z[i] \) where \( w \neq 0 \).
	Consider \( \frac{z}{w} \in \mathbb C \).
	This has distance less than 1 from the nearest element \( q \) of \( R \).
	Let \( r = z - z q \in R \).
	Then \( z = w q + r \) where
	\[ \varphi(r) = \abs{r}^2 = \abs{z - w q}^2 < \abs{w}^2 = \varphi(w) \]
	So property (ii) is satisfied.

	Hence \( F[X] \) and \( \mathbb Z[i] \) are principal ideal domains.
\end{example}
\begin{example}
	Let \( A \) be a nonzero \( n \times n \) matrix over a field \( F \).
	Let \( I = \qty{f \in F[X] \colon f(A) = 0} \).
	\( I \) is an ideal.
	Indeed, if \( f, g \in I \), then \( (f-g)(A) = f(A) - g(A) = 0 \), and for \( f \in I \) and \( g \in F[X] \), we have \( (f \cdot g)(A) = f(A) \cdot g(A) = 0 \) as required.
	Since \( F[X] \) is a principal ideal domain, \( I = (f) \) for some polynomial \( f \in F[X] \).
	All units in \( F[X] \) are the non-zero constant polynomials.
	Hence, the polynomial of smallest degree in \( I \) is unique up to multiplication by a unit, so without loss of generality we may assume \( f \) is monic.
	This yields the minimal polynomial of \( A \).
\end{example}
\begin{example}
	Let \( \mathbb F_2 \) be the finite field of order 2, which is isomorphic to \( \faktor{\mathbb Z}{2 \mathbb Z} \).
	Let \( f(X) \) be the polynomial \( X^3 + X + 1 \in \mathbb F_2[X] \).

	We claim that \( f \) is irreducible.
	Suppose \( f = gh \) where the degrees of \( g, h \) are positive.
	Since the degree of \( f \) is 3, one of \( g, h \) must have degree 1.
	Hence \( f \) has a root.
	But we can check that \( f(0) = f(1) = 1 \) so \( f \) has no root in \( \mathbb F_2 \).
	Hence \( f \) is irreducible as required.

	Since \( \mathbb F_2[X] \) is a principal ideal domain, we have that \( (f) \triangleleft \mathbb F_2[X] \) is a maximal ideal.
	Hence, \( \faktor{\mathbb F_2[X]}{(f)} \) is a field.
	We can verify that this field has order 8, using the Euclidean algorithm.
	Any element in this quotient has coset representative \( aX^2 + bX + c \) for \( a,b,c \in \mathbb F_2 \).
	We can show that all 8 of these possibilities yields different polynomials.
	So we have constructed a field of order 8.
	This technique will be explored further in Part II Galois Theory.
\end{example}
