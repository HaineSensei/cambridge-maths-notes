In this course, we explore the basics of quantum mechanics using the Schr\"odinger equation.
This equation explains how a quantum wavefunction changes over time.
By solving the Schr\"odinger equation with different inputs and boundary conditions, we can understand some of the ways in which quantum mechanics differs from classical physics, explaining some of the scientific discoveries of the past century.
We prove some theoretical facts about quantum operators and observables, such as the uncertainty theorem, which roughly states that it is impossible to know both the position and momentum of a particle.
