\subsection{Basic definitions}
\begin{definition}
	A \textit{topological surface} is a topological space \( \Sigma \) such that
	\begin{enumerate}[(i)]
		\item for all points \( p \in \Sigma \), there exists an open neighbourhood \( p \in U \subset \Sigma \) such that \( U \) is homeomorphic to \( \mathbb R^2 \), or a disk \( D^2 \subset \mathbb R^2 \), with its usual Euclidean topology;
		\item \( \Sigma \) is Hausdorff and second countable.
	\end{enumerate}
\end{definition}
\begin{remark}
	\( \mathbb R^2 \) is homeomorphic to the open disk \( D(0,1) = \qty{ x \in \mathbb R^2 \colon \norm{x} < 1 } \).
	Recall that a space \( X \) is Hausdorff if two points \( p \neq q \in X \) have open neighbourhoods \( U, V \) such that \( U \cap V = \varnothing \).
	A space \( X \) is \textit{second countable} if it has a countable base; there exists a countable family of open sets \( U_i \), such that every open set is a union of some of the \( U_i \).

	Note that subspaces of Hausdorff and second countable spaces are also Hausdorff and second countable.
	In particular, Euclidean space \( \mathbb R^n \) is Hausdorff (as \( \mathbb R^n \) is a metic space) and second countable (consider the set of balls \( D(p,q) \) for points \( p \) with rational coordinates, and rational radii \( q \)).
	Hence, any subspace of \( \mathbb R^n \) is implicitly Hausdorff and second countable.
	These topological requirements are typically not the purpose of considering topological spaces, but they are occasionally technical requirements to prove interesting theorems.
\end{remark}
\begin{example}
	\( \mathbb R^2 \) is a topological surface.
	Any open subset of \( \mathbb R^2 \) is also a topological surface.
	For example, \( \mathbb R^2 \setminus \qty{0} \) and \( \mathbb R^2 \setminus \qty{(0,0)} \cup \qty{\qty(0, \frac{1}{n}) \colon n = 1, 2, \dots} \) are topological surfaces.
\end{example}
\begin{example}
	Let \( f \colon \mathbb R^2 \to \mathbb R \) be a continuous function.
	The graph of \( f \), denoted \( \Gamma_f \), is defined by
	\[ \Gamma_f = \qty{(x,y,f(x,y)) \colon (x,y) \in \mathbb R^2} \]
	with the subspace topology when embedded in \( \mathbb R^3 \).
	Recall that a product topology \( X \times Y \) has the feature that \( f \colon Z \to X \times Y \) is continuous if and only if \( \pi_x \circ f \colon Z \to X \) and \( \pi_y \circ f \colon Z \to Y \) are continuous.
	Hence, any graph \( \Gamma \subseteq X \times Y \) is homeomorphic to \( X \) if \( f \) is continuous.
	Indeed, the projection \( \pi_x \) projects each point in the graph onto the domain.
	The function \( s \colon x \mapsto (x,f(x)) \) is continuous by the above.
	In particular, in our case, the graph \( \Gamma_f \) is homeomorphic to \( \mathbb R^2 \), which we know is a surface.
\end{example}
\begin{remark}
	As a topological surface, \( \Gamma_f \) is independent of the function \( f \).
	However, we will later introduce more ways to describe topological spaces that will ascribe new properties to \( \Gamma_f \) which do depend on \( f \).
\end{remark}
\begin{example}
	The sphere:
	\[ S^2 = \qty{(x,y,z) \in \mathbb R^3 \colon x^2 + y^2 + z^2 = 1} \]
	is a topological surface, when using the subspace topology in \( \mathbb R^3 \).
	Consider the stereographic projection of \( S^2 \) onto \( \mathbb R^2 \) from the north pole \( (0,0,1) \).
	The projection satisfies \( \pi_+ \colon S^2 \setminus \qty{(0,0,1)} \) and
	\[ (x,y,z) \mapsto \qty(\frac{x}{1-z}, \frac{y}{1-z}) \]
	Certainly, \( \pi_+ \) is continuous, since we do not consider the point \( (0,0,1) \) to be in its domain.
	The inverse map is given by
	\[ (u,v) \mapsto \qty(\frac{2u}{u^2+v^2+1}, \frac{2v}{u^2+v^2+1}, \frac{u^2+v^2-1}{u^2+v^2+1}) \]
	This is also a continuous function.
	Hence \( \pi_+ \) is a homeomorphism.
	Similarly, we can construct the stereographic projection from the south pole, \( \pi_- \).
	This is a homeomorphism.
	Hence, every point in \( S^2 \) lies either in the domain of \( \pi_+ \) or \( \pi_- \), and hence sits in an open set \( S^2 \setminus \qty{(0,0,1)} \) or \( S^2 \setminus \qty{(0,0,-1)} \) which is homeomorphic to \( \mathbb R^2 \).
\end{example}
\begin{remark}
	\( S^2 \) is compact by the Heine-Borel theorem; it is a closed bounded set in \( \mathbb R^3 \).
\end{remark}
\begin{example}
	The real projective plane is a topological surface.
	The group \( \mathbb Z / 2 \) acts on \( S^2 \) by homeomorphisms via the \textit{antipodal map} \( a \colon S^2 \to S^2 \), mapping \( x \mapsto -x \).
	There exists a homeomorphism \( \mathbb Z / 2 \) to the group \( \mathrm{Homeo}(\mathbb S^2) \) of homeomorphisms of \( S^2 \), by mapping \( 1 + \mathbb Z \mapsto a \).
	We now define the real projective plane to be the quotient of \( S^2 \) given by identifying every point \( x \) with its image \( -x \) under \( a \).
	\[ \mathbb R \mathbb P^2 = \faktor{S^2}{\mathbb Z/2} = \faktor{S^2}{\sim};\quad x \sim a(x) \]
	\begin{lemma}
		\( \mathbb R \mathbb P^2 \) bijects with the set of straight lines in \( \mathbb R^3 \) through the origin.
	\end{lemma}
	\begin{proof}
		Any line through the origin intersects \( S^2 \) exactly in a pair of antipodal points \( x, -x \).
		Similarly, pairs of antipodal points uniquely define a line through the origin.
	\end{proof}
	\begin{lemma}
		\( \mathbb R \mathbb P^2 \) is a topological surface.
	\end{lemma}
	\begin{proof}
		We must check that \( \mathbb R \mathbb P^2 \) is Hausdorff since it is constructed by a quotient, not a subspace.
		If \( X \) is a space and \( q \colon X \to Y \) is a quotient map, then by definition \( V \subset Y \) is open if and only if \( q^{-1}(V) \subset X \) is open.
		If \( [p] \neq [q] \in \mathbb R \mathbb P^2 \), then \( \pm p, \pm q \in S^2 \) are distinct antipodal pairs.
		We can therefore construct distinct open disks around \( p, q \) in \( S^2 \), and their antipodal images.
		These uniquely define open neighbourhoods of \( [p], [q] \), which are disjoint.

		Similarly, we can check that \( \mathbb R \mathbb P^2 \) is second countable.
		We know that \( S^2 \) is second countable, so let \( \mathcal U \) be a countable base for the topology on \( S^2 \).
		Without loss of generality, we can assert that for all sets \( U \in \mathcal U \), we have \( -U \in \mathcal U \).
		Let \( \overline{\mathcal U} \) be the family of open sets in \( \mathbb R \mathbb P^2 \) of the form \( q(U) \cup q(-U) \) for \( U \in \mathcal U \), where \( q \) is the quotient map.
		Now, if \( V \subseteq \mathbb R \mathbb P^2 \) is open, then by definition \( q^{-1}(V) \) is open in \( S^2 \) hence \( q^{-1}(V) \) contains some \( U \in \mathcal U \) and hence contains \( U \cup (-U) \).
		Hence \( \overline{\mathcal U} \) is a countable base for the quotient topology on \( \mathbb R \mathbb P^2 \).

		Finally, let \( p \in S^2 \) and \( [p] \in \mathbb R \mathbb P^2 \) its image.
		Let \( \overline D \) be a small (contained in an open hemisphere) closed disk, which is a neighbourhood of \( p \in S^2 \).
		The quotient map restricted to \( \overline D \), written \( \eval{q}_{\overline D} \colon \overline D \to q(\overline D) \subset \mathbb R \mathbb P^2 \), is a continuous function from a compact space to a Hausdorff space.
		Further, \( q \) is injective on \( \overline D \) since the disk was contained entirely in a single hemisphere.
		The topological inverse function theorem states that a continuous bijection from a compact space to a Hausdorff space is a homeomorphism.
		So \( \eval{q}_{\overline D} \) is a homeomorphism from \( \overline D \) to \( q(\overline D) \).
		This then induces the homeomorphism \( \eval{q}_{D} \) from the open disk \( D = {\overline D}^\circ \) to \( q(D) \).
		So by construction, \( [p] \in q(D) \); it has an open neighbourhood in \( \mathbb R \mathbb P^2 \) which is homeomorphic to an open disk, concluding the proof.
	\end{proof}
\end{example}
\begin{example}
	Let \( S^1 \) be the unit circle in \( \mathbb C \), and then we define the torus to be the product space \( S^1 \times S^1 \), with the subspace topology from \( \mathbb C^2 \) (which is identical to the product topology).
	\begin{lemma}
		The torus is a topological surface.
	\end{lemma}
	\begin{proof}
		Consider the map \( e \colon \mathbb R^2 \to S^1 \times S^1 \) defined by
		\[ (s,t) \mapsto \qty(e^{2\pi i s}, e^{2 \pi i t}) \]
		Note that this induces a map \( \hat e \) from \( \faktor{\mathbb R^2}{\mathbb Z^2} \), since \( e \) is constant under translations by \( \mathbb Z^2 \).

			\begin{tikzcd}
				\mathbb R^2 \arrow[d, "q"'] \arrow[r, "e"]             & S^1 \times S^1 \\
				\faktor{\mathbb R^2}{\mathbb Z^2} \arrow[ru, "\hat e"] &
			\end{tikzcd}
		\end{center}

		Under the quotient topology given by the quotient map \( q \), \( \faktor{\mathbb R^2}{\mathbb Z^2} \) is a topological space.
		The map \( [0,1]^2 \to \mathbb R^2 \to \faktor{\mathbb R^2}{\mathbb Z^2} \) is surjective, so \( \faktor{\mathbb R^2}{\mathbb Z^2} \) is compact.
		So \( \hat e \) is a continuous map from a compact space to a Hausdorff space, and \( \hat e \) is bijective, so \( \hat e \) is a homeomorphism.
		We already have that \( S^1 \times S^1 \) is compact and Hausdorff (as a closed and bounded set in \( \mathbb C^2 \)), so it suffices to show it is locally homeomorphic to \( \mathbb R^2 \).
		Let \( [p] = q(p) \in S^1 \times S^1 \), then we can choose a small disk \( \overline D(p) \) such that \( \overline D(p) \cap \qty(\overline D(p) + (n,m)) = \varnothing \) for non-zero \( (n,m) \in \mathbb Z^2 \).
		Hence \( \eval{e}_{\overline D(p)} \) is injective and \( \eval{q}_{\overline D(p)} \) is injective.
		Now, restricting to the open disk as before, we can find an open disk neighbourhood of \( [p] \).
		Since \( [p] \) was chosen arbitrarily, \( S^1 \times S^1 \) is a topological surface.
	\end{proof}
\end{example}
\begin{example}
	Let \( P \) be a planar Euclidean polygon, with oriented edges.
	We will pair the edges, and without loss of generality we will assume that paired edges have the same Euclidean length.
	\begin{center}
		\tikzfig{torus_polygon}
		\quad
		\tikzfig{other_square_polygon}
		\quad
		\tikzfig{hexagon}
	\end{center}
	We can assign letter names to each edge pair, and denote a polygon by the sequence of edges found when traversing in a clockwise orientation.
	The edge pair name is inverted if the edge is traversed in the reverse direction.
	Note the difference between the annotations on the first two shapes above, due to the reversed direction of the edge.
	If two edges \( e, \hat e \) are paired, this defines a unique Euclidean isometry from \( e \) to \( \hat e \) respecting the orientation, which will be written \( f_{e\hat e} \colon e \to \hat e \).
	The set of all such functions generate an equivalence relation on the polygon, identifying paired edges with each other.
	\begin{lemma}
		\( \faktor{P}{\sim} \), with the quotient topology, is a topological surface.
	\end{lemma}
	\begin{example}
		Consider the torus, defined here as \( \faktor{[0,1]^2}{\sim} \).
		Let \( P \) be the polygon \( [0,1]^2 \).
		If \( p \) is in the interior of \( P \), then construct a sufficiently small disk that lies entirely within the interior.
		The quotient map is injective on the closure of the disk and is a homeomorphism on its interior.

		Let \( p \) be on an edge, but not a vertex.
		Let us say without loss of generality that \( p = (0,y_0) \sim (1,y_0) \).
		Let \( \delta \) be sufficiently small that the half-disks centred on \( p \) with radius \( \delta \) do not intersect any vertices.
		Then we define a map from the union of the two half-disks to the disk \( B(0,\delta) \subseteq \mathbb R^2 \) via \( (x,y) \mapsto (x,y-y_0) \) or \( (x,y) \mapsto (x-1,y-y_0) \), which will be a bijective map.
		Recall the gluing lemma from Analysis and Topology: that if \( X = A \cup B \) is a union of closed subspaces, and \( f \colon A \to Y \), \( g \colon B \to Y \) are continuous and \( \eval{f}_{A \cap B} = \eval{g}_{A \cap B} \), they define a continuous map on \( X \).
