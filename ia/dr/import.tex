In the first part of this course, we study the classical laws of motion.
We apply physical laws to study various phenomena such as gravity, friction, and orbits.
Many such laws take the form of differential equations, and by solving these equations we can compute things like trajectories of particles.

In the second part, we study special relativity.
We explore things like time dilation and the twin paradox, and how the laws of physics seem to change when particles are travelling very close to the speed of light.
