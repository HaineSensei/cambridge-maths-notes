\subsection{Motion in a central force field}
By Newton's second law, the force in a central force field is given by
\[
	m\ddot{\vb r} = \vb F = -\grad V = -\frac{\dd{V}}{\dd{r}} \vb e_r
\]
The results from the previous lecture give
\begin{equation}
	m\left(\ddot r - r\dot\theta^2\right) \vb e_r + m\left(2\dot r \dot \theta + r \ddot \theta\right) \vb e_\theta = \frac{-\dd{V}}{\dd{r}} \vb e_r \tag{\(\ast\)}
\end{equation}
But the right hand side has no angular component, so \(m\left(2\dot r \dot \theta + r \ddot \theta\right) = 0\).
Then
\[
	\frac{m}{r} \frac{\dd}{\dd{t}}\left(r^2 \dot\theta\right) = 0
\]
So the quantity \(h = r^2 \dot\theta\), known as the \textit{specific} angular momentum (since it contains no mass component) is constant.
Note that the angular momentum \(\vb L\) is given by
\[
	\vb L = m\vb r \times \dot{\vb r} = mr\vb e_r \times \left( \dot r\vb e_r + r\dot\theta \vb e_\theta \right) = mr^2 \dot\theta \vb e_z
\]
Hence the magnitude of the angular momentum is constant.
Now, let us consider the radial component in \((\ast)\).
\begin{align*}
	m\ddot r - mr\dot\theta^2 & = -\frac{\dd{V}}{\dd{r}}                    \\
	m\ddot r                  & = -\frac{\dd{V}}{\dd{r}} + \frac{mh^2}{r^3} \\
	m\ddot r                  & = -\frac{\dd{V}_\text{eff}}{\dd{r}}
\end{align*}
where
\[
	V_\text{eff}(r) = V(r) + \frac{mh^2}{2r^2}
\]
where \(V_\text{eff}\) is called the effective potential.
In other words, the motion of the particle is equivalent to one-dimensional motion under the influence of the effective potential.
The energy of the particle is given by
\[
	T + V(r) = \frac{1}{2}m\left( \dot r^2 + r^2 \dot\theta^2 \right) + V(r) = \frac{1}{2}m\dot r^2 + \frac{mh^2}{2r^2} + V(r) = \frac{1}{2}m\dot r^2 + V_\text{eff}(r)
\]
which is consistent with our description of the effective potential.

\subsection{Orbits under gravity}
As an example, let us consider
\[
	V(r) = \frac{-GMm}{r};\quad V_\text{eff}(r) = \frac{-GMm}{r} + \frac{mh^2}{2r^2}
\]
The effective potential has a single minimum point at \(r_\ast\), and a single root at \(r_0\).
In other words, \(V'_\text{eff}(r_\ast) = 0\) and \(V_\text{eff}(r_0) = 0\).
We can compute that
\[
	r_0 = \frac{h^2}{2GM};\quad r_\ast = \frac{h^2}{GM}
\]
The minimum energy is therefore
\[
	E_\text{min} = \frac{-m(GM)^2}{2h^2}
\]
What is the possible motion of the particle?
At \(E = E_\text{min}\), we have \(r(t) = r_\ast\), an equilibrium position.
Further, \(\dot\theta = \frac{h}{r_\ast^2}\) everywhere.
At \(E_\text{min} < E < 0\), then \(r(t)\) oscillates between a minimum point (periapsis/perihelion/perigee) and a maximum point (apoapsis/aphelion/apogee), and \(\dot\theta\) varies.
If \(E_\text{min} \geq 0\), the particle escapes to infinity.
This is sometimes called an unbound orbit.

\subsection{Stability of circular orbits}
Consider a general potential \(V(r)\).
Does a circular orbit exist, and is it stable?
We will assume that the angular momentum is given and non-zero.
For a circular orbit, the radius is a constant value \(r_\ast\), so \(\ddot r = 0\) and hence \(V'_\text{eff}(r_\ast) = 0\).
We know that we have a stable equilibrium if \(V_\text{eff}\) has a minimum at this point.
Correspondingly, it is unstable if this is a maximum.
So, for instance, it is stable if \(V''_\text{eff}(r_\ast) > 0\).
Now, let us rewrite these conditions in terms of \(V(r)\).
\[
	V'(r_\ast) - \frac{mh^2}{r_\ast^3} = 0;\quad V''(r_\ast) = V''(r_\ast) + \frac{3mh^2}{r_\ast^4} > 0
\]
We can combine these to give the condition for stability as
\[
	V''(r_\ast) + \frac{3V'(r_\ast)}{r_\ast} > 0
\]
Now let us consider an example,
\[
	V(r) = \frac{-km}{r^p}
\]
where \(p>0\), \(k>0\).
If \(p=1\), this is an example of an inverse square law.
We have a circular orbit if
\[
	\frac{pkm}{r_\ast^{p+1}} - \frac{mh^2}{r_\ast^3} = 0
\]
Hence,
\[
	r_\ast^{p-2} = \frac{pkm}{mh^2} \implies r_\ast = \left( \frac{pkm}{mh^2} \right)^{\frac{1}{p-2}}
\]
So there exists a circular orbit for all \(h\) provided \(p \neq 2\).
Is this a stable orbit?
\[
	V''(r_\ast) + \frac{3V'(r_\ast)}{r_\ast} = \frac{-kmp(p+1)}{r_\ast^{p+2}} + \frac{3kmp}{r_\ast^{p+2}} = \frac{p(2-p)km}{r_\ast^{p+2}}
\]
So this is greater than zero (stable) if \(0 < p < 2\) and less than zero (unstable) if \(p > 2\).

\subsection{The orbit equation}
What shape does a non-circular orbit trace out?
We could in principle find \(r(t)\) by the energy equation
\[
	E = \frac{1}{2}m \dot r^2 + V_\text{eff}(r) = \text{constant}
\]
Hence
\[
	t = \pm \sqrt{\frac{m}{2}} \int^r \frac{\dd{u}}{\sqrt{E - V_\text{eff}(u)}}
\]
Then we can use \(r(t)^2\dot \theta = h\) to deduce \(\theta(t)\).
However in practice, this is not useful.
An analytic solution is only possible for a small family of effective potential functions.
It is somewhat more convenient to find \(r\) in terms of \(\theta\), not in terms of \(t\).
We can write
\[
	\frac{\dd}{\dd{t}} = \frac{\dd{\theta}}{\dd{t}} \frac{\dd}{\dd{\theta}} = \frac{h}{r^2} \frac{\dd}{\dd{\theta}}
\]
Applying this to Newton's second law, we have
\[
	m\frac{h}{r^2} \frac{\dd}{\dd{\theta}}\left( \frac{h}{r^2} \frac{\dd}{\dd{\theta}} r \right) - \frac{mh^2}{r^3} = F(r)
\]
The \(\frac{h}{r^2} \frac{\dd}{\dd{\theta}} r\) term suggests using the substitution \(u = \frac{1}{r}\).
Then
\[
	mhu^2 \frac{\dd}{\dd{\theta}}\left( -h\frac{\dd{u}}{\dd{\theta}} \right) - mh^2u^3 = F(u^{-1})
\]
\[
	\frac{\dd^2 u}{\dd{\theta}^2} + u = \frac{-1}{mh^2u^2}F(u^{-1})
\]
This is known as the orbit equation.
We can solve this for \(u\) as a function of \(\theta\).
