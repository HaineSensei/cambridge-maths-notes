\subsection{Definitions}
We define multidimensional real space as follows:
\[
	\mathbb R^n = \{ \vb x = (x_1, x_2, \cdots, x_n) : x_i \in \mathbb R \}
\]
We can define addition and scalar multiplication by mapping these operations over each term in the tuple.
Therefore, we have a notion of linear combinations of vectors and hence a concept of parallel vectors.
We can say, like before in \(\mathbb R^3\), that \(\vb x \parallel \vb y\) if and only if \(\vb x = \lambda \vb y\) or \(\vb y = \lambda \vb x\).

\subsection{Inner product}
We define an operator analogous to the scalar product in \(\mathbb R^3\).
The inner product is defined as \(x \cdot y = x_i y_i\).
Directly from this definition, we can deduce some properties:
\begin{itemize}
	\item (symmetric) \(\vb x \cdot \vb y = \vb y \cdot \vb x\)
	\item (bilinear) \((\lambda \vb x + \lambda'\vb x')\cdot \vb y = \lambda \vb x\cdot \vb y + \lambda' \vb x' \cdot \vb y\)
	\item (positive definite) \(\vb x \cdot \vb x \geq 0\), and the equality holds if and only if \(\vb x = \vb 0\).
\end{itemize}

\subsection{Norm}
We can define the norm of a vector (similar to the concept of length in three-dimension space), denoted \(\abs {\vb x}\), by \(\abs{\vb x}^2 = \vb x \cdot \vb x\).
We can now define orthogonality as follows: \(\vb x \perp \vb y \iff \vb x \cdot \vb y = 0\).

\subsection{Basis vectors}
We define the standard basis vectors \(\vb e_1, \vb e_2, \dots, \vb e_n\) by setting each element of the tuple \(\vb e_i\) to zero apart from the \(i\)th element, which is set to one.
Also, we redefine the Kronecker \(\delta\) to be valid in higher-dimensional space.
Note that under this definition, the standard basis vectors are orthonormal because \(\vb e_i \cdot \vb e_j = \delta_{ij}\).

\subsection{Cauchy-Schwarz inequality}
\begin{proposition}
	For vectors \(\vb x, \vb y\) in \(\mathbb R^n\), \(\abs{\vb x \cdot \vb y} \leq \abs{\vb x} \abs{\vb y}\), where the equality is true if and only if \(\vb x \parallel \vb y\).
\end{proposition}
\begin{proof}
	If \(\vb y = \vb 0\), then the result is immediate.
	So suppose that \(\vb y \neq 0\), then for some \(\lambda \in \mathbb R\), we have
	\begin{align*}
		\abs{\vb x - \lambda \vb y}^2 & =
		(\vb x - \lambda \vb y) \cdot (\vb x - \lambda \vb y)                                                          \\
		                              & = \abs{\vb x}^2 - 2 \lambda \vb x \cdot \vb y + \lambda^2 \abs{\vb y}^2 \geq 0
	\end{align*}
	As this is a positive real quadratic in \(\lambda\) that is always greater than zero, it has at most one real root.
	Therefore the discriminant is less than or equal to zero.
	\[
		(-2 \vb x \cdot \vb y)^2 - 4 \abs{\vb x}^2\abs{\vb y}^2 \leq 0
		\implies \abs{\vb x \cdot \vb y} \leq \abs{\vb x}\abs{\vb y}
	\]
	where the equality only holds if \(\vb x\) and \(\vb y\) are parallel (i.e.\ when \(\vb x - \lambda \vb y\) equals zero for some \(\lambda\)).
\end{proof}

\subsection{Triangle inequality}
Following from the Cauchy-Schwarz inequality,
\begin{align*}
	\abs{\vb x + \vb y}^2
	 & = \abs{\vb x}^2 + 2(\vb x \cdot \vb y) + \abs{\vb y}^2        \\
	 & \leq \abs{\vb x}^2 + 2 \abs{\vb x}\abs{\vb y} + \abs{\vb y}^2 \\
	 & = \left(\abs{\vb x} + \abs{\vb y}\right)^2
\end{align*}
where the equality holds under the same conditions as above.

\subsection{Levi-Civita epsilon in higher dimensions}
Note that the Levi-Civita \(\varepsilon\) has three indices in \(\mathbb R^3\).
We can extend this \(\varepsilon\) to higher and lower dimensions by increasing or reducing the amount of indices.
It does not make logical sense to use the same \(\varepsilon\) without changing the amount of indices to define, for example, a vector product in four-dimensional space, since we would have unused indices.
The expression \((\vb x \times \vb y)_k = \varepsilon_{ijk} \vb a_i \vb b_j\) works because there is one free index, \(k\), on the right hand side, so we can use this to calculate the values of each element of the result.

We can, however, use this \(\varepsilon\) to extend the notion of a scalar triple product to other dimensions, for example two-dimensional space, with \([\vb a, \vb b] := \varepsilon_{ij} \vb a_i \vb b_j\).
This is the signed area of the parallelogram spanning \(\vb a\) and \(\vb b\).
